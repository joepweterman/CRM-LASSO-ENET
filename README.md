# CRM-LASSO-ENET
Alternative versions of the cellwise robust M regression, with simulation study included. It contains the original files of the R package crmReg with some extra R files used in for the alternative versions. 
The repository contains the R package crmReg, which includes the cellwise robust M (CRM) regression algorithm implementations and the Sparse Direction of Maximal Outlyingness (SPADIMO) algorithm. The repository also includes two new CRM functions in which  two alternative versions of a SPADIMO algorithm are used, and thus also two new SPADIMO files. In the new SPADIMO functions the regression used for the initial estimation of the vector regression was replaced by a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and an Elastic Net regression. Additionally, the repository includes the predict functions for the two new fitted CRM regression models. The R scripts for the simulations studies and the real-world application as used in our research are also included.
